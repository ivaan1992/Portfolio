This is my first professional project I'm doing for Microverse.

This project consists in cloning a Figma template. 

This was the template I choosed:
<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=23%3A10">Figma Template</a>

<b><h3>MOBILE VERSION</h3></b>

To cloning Mobile Version from this template I followed these steps: 

1-. Clone the header which includes the name and the hamburguer icon menu. 

2-. Clone the headline section which includes My name, experience, language, frameworks, skills and the social media logos.  

3-. Clone "MY WORK RECENT" section which includes the blank image, multipost stories, languages and buttons. 

4-. Finally I just clone the form and the final social media logos. 

5-. One of the difference between Desktop and Mobile version is the last black line.  

<b>This is the Mobile Version</b>
